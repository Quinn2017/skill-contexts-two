## Skill-Contexts-Two

This is simply a test-run of the 'adds_context' and 'removes_context' for Mycroft for using contexts to enable intents.

See this guide for the official Mycroft instructions: https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/conversational-context/

For some reason, I did not have any luck with it at first. And I was only able to get contexts to work by reversing the order in which they are called.
